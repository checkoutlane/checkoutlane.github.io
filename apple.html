    <div class="story apple">
        <p>At some point when I was in middle school, my parents read somewhere about pesticide residue on apple skin. From then on, all of the apple slices in my lunch were peeled. I didn’t think much of it, since the skin always got stuck in my teeth anyways. One day at school during lunch, my friend looked at me as I picked up a piece of apple and asked, “are you eating chunks of raw potato?”
