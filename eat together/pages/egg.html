        <p>Eggs, the most disgusting thing on earth</p>
        <p>To me,  eggs are the worst food ever. Why? when I was little, I ate eggs, but I don’t really recall having feelings towards them because I was so little then. It was when I was about five years old did I declare that I hated eggs. I apparently thought that boiled eggs were stinky and disgusting (which, btw, is still how I think of eggs) and they smell like sulfur, and scrambled eggs are too crumbly. When I was just beginning to dislike eggs, I wanted to peel my mom’s boiled egg she was eating for breakfast, but I forgot that I had green highlighter on my hands, and started peeling. In the end, the egg almost turned a bright green; and then my mom had to throw it away. Since then, my entire family has been trying to trick me into eating eggs, but it mostly fails.I mean, I’ll eat cakes and stuff, but I refuse to eat sunny side up eggs, fried rice eggs, and especially, boiled eggs. I am not sure if me coloring an egg impacted my decision, but I think it might have somehow. I try to avoid eggs at all times, but it’s funny because my friends and I all made up food nicknames like Olivea (Olivia), Avacado (Ava), and some other ones that I can’t really remember. I am, uncoincedentally, Eggstelle (My name is Estelle) and all my friends know that I don’t like eggs. At least, I hope they do...if they don’t, then I don’t know if they count as my true friends because all of my friends know I hate eggs, because that’s one of the first things I tell them.
