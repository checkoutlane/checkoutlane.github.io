       <p>If I could only eat one dish every day, it would be fried rice. Though this might be cheating a little, since the possibilities of the dish are truly endless. Fried rice, for me, consists quintessentially scrambled eggs, scallions, and long grain rice. Anything else in the kitchen or pantry is fair game. My grandma always puts diced cucumbers in her fried rice, which I think is the only occasion where cooked cucumbers are acceptable. The fried rice I make most often is very American, all frozen peas and carrots from a bag and rice and eggs all wrapped up in a blanket of dark soy sauce. The color is really important here; a nice toasty brown, not too pale as to suggest blandness, but not too dark either as no one wants to chug water with it. Iâ€™ll occasionally venture out into the territory of unfamiliar sauces and leftover meat, but these usually cannot be replicated, for better or worse. A perfect bowl of fried rice promises layers of savoriness, a hint of sweet, and a fridge devoid of wrinkly vegetables. The whole package in one bite. A real one-pot meal, unlike <a href="https://youtu.be/NGgpSWcaV1U">this</a>.</p>
