    <div class="story raspberry">
      <p>The first time I encountered raspberries was not in their natural form, but in a jelly bean. On one of my first trips to the grocery store after I moved to the US, I followed my theory that red colored candy tends to taste good (except for Red Hots, never again). That day I fell down the rabbit hole of raspberry flavored foods: cookies, cakes, ice cream, anything. I’ve since rarely disliked a raspberry flavor, which has only deepened my trust for it. So it was fate that our current home already had raspberry bushes growing when we moved in. </p>
      <p>raspberry bushes in our backyard are prickly, fickle, and infested with Japanese beetles. Yet, I still wait expectantly for fruit each July, savoring every little berry straight off the canes. There don’t necessarily taste better than the store-bought ones, but seeing them grow day-by-day is makes the ruby-colored berries more precious. </p> 
      <p>Anywhere I eat a raspberry, it takes me to sitting under an umbrella on my porch on a hot summer day, a handful of berries picked from the bush, still warm and translucent from the sunlight. It’s soft, first sweet, then tart, and once you get to the seeds, grassy and crunchy. </p>
