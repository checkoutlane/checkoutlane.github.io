            Eggs, the most disgusting thing on earth
            <br> 
            To me,  eggs are the worst food ever. Why? when I was little, I ate eggs, but I don’t really recall having feelings towards them because I was so little then. It was when I was about five years old did I declare that I hated eggs. I apparently thought that boiled eggs were stinky and disgusting (which, btw, is still how I think of eggs) and they smell like sulfur, and scrambled eggs are too crumbly. When I was just beginning to dislike eggs, I wanted to peel my mom’s boiled egg she was eating for breakfast, but I forgot that I had green highlighter on my hands, and started peeling. In the end, the egg almost turned a bright green; and then my mom had to throw it away. Since then, my entire family has been trying to trick me into eating eggs, but it mostly fails. I mean, I’ll eat cakes and stuff, but I refuse to eat sunny side up eggs, fried rice eggs, and especially, boiled eggs. I am not sure if me coloring an egg impacted my decision, but I think it might have somehow. I try to avoid eggs at all times, but it’s funny because my friends and I all made up food nicknames like Olivea (Olivia), Avacado (Ava), and some other ones that I can’t really remember. I am, uncoincedentally, Eggstelle (My name is Estelle) and all my friends know that I don’t like eggs. At least, I hope they do...if they don’t, then I don’t know if they count as my true friends because all of my friends know I hate eggs, because that’s one of the first things I tell them.
