        If I could only eat one dish every day, it would be fried rice. Though this might cheating a little, since the possibilities of the dish are truly endless. 
        Nowadays, the fried rice I make, and my mom makes, is looking more and more American with the frozen peas and carrots from a bag and rice and eggs all wrapped up in a blanket of soysauce. The color is really important here; a nice toasty brown, not to pale as to suggest blandness, and not too dark either as no one wants to chug water with rice. A perfect bowl of fried rice promises layers of savoriness, a hint of sweet, and a fridge devoid of wrinkly vegetables. I love how you get the whole package in one bite. It’s a real one-pot meal and really quick too; I’ve timed myself doing it in 15 minutes, including clean up time. 
        There are vegetables that I eat only when it’s in fried rice: peas and cooked cucumbers. I’d rather not eat them in any other dish.
